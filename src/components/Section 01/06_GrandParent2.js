/* [07] Same element reference */

import React, { useState } from 'react'
import Parent2 from './06_Parent2'
import Child2 from './06_Child2'

function GrandParent2() {
  const [newCount, setNewCount] = useState(0)
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Grand Parent 2 component</h3>
      <button onClick={() => setNewCount(c => c + 1)}>New Count : {newCount}</button>
      <Parent2 newCount={newCount}>
        <Child2 />
      </Parent2>
    </div>
  )
}

export default GrandParent2

/*
    When we click on the Grand Parent Count button, all the components gets re-rendered this is because when the parent component re-renders, all its child components re-renders, also in this case, React knows that the Parent2 component is not rendering because of its own state change but rather because of the Grand Parent component re-rendering that means the props could have changed hence Child 2 component also re-renders.

    Summary - Same element reference
    In react, when a parent component renders, React will recursively render all of its child components.

    "Unnecessary renders" - where the child component goes through the render phase but not the commit phase.

    We can extract the expensive child component and instead pass it down as props to the parent component.

    Whenever there is a re-render caused by a change in the state of the parent component, React will optimize the re-render for you by knowing that the props has to be referencing the same element before and after the render.
