/*
    Unnecessary Renders -

    When a parent component renders, React will recursively render all of its child components.
    Rendering is not a bad thing as it is how React knows whether it needs to actually make any changes to the DOM.
    "Unnecessary renders" -> where the child component goes through the render phase but not the commit phase.

    Causes for re-render -
    1. A component can re-render if it calls a setter function or a dispatch function.
    2. A component can re-render if its parent component gets rendered.

    Same Element Reference -

    A Component can change its state but not props. Based on this, React will automatically provide the optimization.
    React looks at optimized Parent2 component (Child2 component passed as props), and sees that it has to convert the button and children prop to a react element.
    Now react sees that this re-render is caused by a state change in optimized Parent2 component.
    Since this component has no way of directly changing the props it is receiving, Children props couldn't have changed.
    Hence, it makes use of the React element that was previously created.
    As a result, Children props has to be referencing the same element from the previous render, will skip the render phase for the Child2 component.
