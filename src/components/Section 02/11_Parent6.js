/*
  On Count button click, the parent as well as child component both renders even though the count is not passed to the memoized component.

  This is because of the person object that we have in the parent component. Every time the parent is rendered a new person object reference is created and then passed in as props to the child component. With the reference changed, React.memo() cannot optimize and the child also re-renders.

  The same thing happens with functions.
